General Instructions:
1. Keep documentation to a bare minimum. Focus on testing and having working code
2. In your tests, NEVER ask for user input, load necessary ENV variables from .env, names are defined in .env.example
3. After the change is tested and working, keep the CHANGELOG.md and README.md in root up to date. You must NOT refactor the readme and only add mentions for the new changes, don't go overboard like a version update.
